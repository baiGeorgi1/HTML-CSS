                        <h2>Epstein Drive</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Epstein Drive is a modified Fusion Drive invented by Solomon Epstein
                            Books â€¢ TV around 130 years ago, in approximately 2213 AD BXT. It
                            enabled humanity to travel beyond Earth and the inner planets and
                            colonize the asteroid belt and the outer planets

                        <h3>Background</h3>
                        <p>
                            The drive utilizes magnetic coil exhaust acceleration to increase drive
                            efficiency, which enables spaceships to sustain thrust throughout the
                            entire voyage. A ship fitted with the efficient Epstein drive is able to
                            run the drive continuously for acceleration to its goal and then after
                            flipping at about the halfway point is able to run the drive
                            continuously during deceleration. Previous engine designs used
                            propellant less efficiently and could not be run long enough to achieve
                            the high velocities that the Epstein drive permitted./p>

                            Since its invention and up until the discovery of the Ring network, the
                            Epstein drive remained the most advanced transportation technology
                            humanity had access to.
