        -   The tags describe document content.
        -   HTML is consumed by web browsers.
        -   The purpose of a web browser is to read HTML documents and compose them into visible or audible web pages.
        -   The browser does not display the HTML tags, it uses the tags to interpret the content of the page.
    -   _HTML Tags:_
        -   Tags are keywords surrounded by angle brackets. - HTML tags normally come in pairs: '<' + 'p' + '>' and '</' + 'p' + '>'
        -   The first tag in a pair is the start tag, the second tag is the end tag.
        -   The end tag is written like the start tag, with a forward slash before the tag name.
        -   Start and end tags are also called opening tags and closing tags.
    -   _Main HTML Tags:_
        -   Describes the start and end of the web page/document - `<html></html>`
        -   Describes the start and end of the metadata section of the document `<head></head>`
        -   Describes the start and end of the web page/document - `<body></body>`
        -   Describes the start and end of the title section of the document - `<title></title>`
    -   _ Example:_

## 2. Typography in CSS.

1.  **What is Typography?** - Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to
    make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed.Typography is the visual component of the written word.

    -   _Styling text_ - Choosing a comfortable measure
        -   The measure is the number of characters in single line of a
            column of text.
        -   Anything from 45 to 75 characters is widely regarded as a satisfactory length of line for a single-column page set in a serifed text face in a text size.
        -   The 66-character line (counting both letters and spaces) is widely regarded as ideal. For multiple column work, a better average is 40 to 50 characters.
    -   _Fonts & Font Famiy_
        -   Font Family:
            -   In typography, a font family (also known as typeface) is a set of one or more fonts each composed of glyphs that share common design features.
            -   Each font of a typeface has a specific weight, style, condensation, width, slant, italicization, ornamentation, and designer or foundry.
        -   Font:
            -   A computer font (or font) is implemented as a digital data file containing a set of graphically related glyphs, characters, or symbols such as dingbats.
            -   Although the term font first referred to a set of movable metal type pieces in one style and size, since the 1990s it is generally used to refer to a set of digital shapes in a single style, scalable to different sizes.
        -   Generic Font Families:
            -   serif
            -   sans-serif
            -   monospace
            -   cursive
            -   fantasy
        -   Web Fonts:
            -   At the time, fetching font files from the web was controversial because fonts meant to be used only for certain web pages could also be downloaded and installed in breach of the font license.

2.  **CSS Units**

    -   _EM & REM:_

        -   Ems are so-called because they are thought to approximate the size of an uppercase letter M, although 1em is significantly larger than this.

         <img src="https://www.pc-koubou.jp/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/css_rem_main2.png" width=350>

        -   The em is a sliding measure. One em is a distance equal to the type size.
        -   In 6-point type, an em is 6 points; in 12 point type an em is 12 points and in 60 point type an em is 60 points.
